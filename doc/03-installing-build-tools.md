Installing Build Tools
======================

The following modules are listed in the `"devDependencies"` field of 
‘package.json’, so running `npm install` will install them in the local 
‘node_modules’ directory. However, you may find it useful to install them 
globally on your machine, in which case the `-g` flag is your friend: 

Install [coffee](http://coffeescript.org/) 1.9.2 on the command line: 
```bash
npm install -g coffee-script
```

Install [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) 1.3.7: 
```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```
